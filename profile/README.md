We are a small research team affiliated with the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://computational-communication.com/), [School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/), Nanjing University. The Socrates Lab is directed by [Dr. **Cheng-Jun Wang**](https://chengjun.github.io/). 



<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
